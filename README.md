## Ruslan Didun Portfolio

    Hi!

    I'm Ruslan Didun, previously a accountant, perpetually a snowboarder, 
    and, currently, transitioning to a career as a full-stack web developer.

    This is my portfolios Readme file, and in it I'll cover what technologies 
    were used, what the design process looked like, and any issues that I ran into.

    Thanks for taking the time, and please take a look at the site below!

    Best,

    Ruslan

## What all that about

This is the second rendition of my portfolio. The app is built with react, where Scss and styling    components lined up with the UI. Some elements were custom coded to allow for a more unique look than the built in styles components.

My friend is a product designer and I've had the good luck to be able to work with him on some of my projects. They designed mobile first wireframes in figma and passed it along to me for development. I'm happy with how it came out as the general layout will be much more scaleable than my previous portfolio(and it looks alot nicer!).

I appreciate you taking the time to look over my work, and look forward to any notes you may have on either my organization or code!
